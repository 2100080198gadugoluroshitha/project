            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>The Polavaram Project has faced several challenges, including environmental concerns, displacement of people, and legal hurdles. The project involves the submergence of several villages, leading to the displacement of thousands of families. Ensuring proper rehabilitation and resettlement of the affected people remains a significant challenge. Additionally, the project has faced opposition from neighboring states over water-sharing issues.</p>
